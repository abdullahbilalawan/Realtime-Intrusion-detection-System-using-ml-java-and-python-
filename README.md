# Realtime-Intrusion-detection-using-ml-java-and-python-
The application of using ML in intrusion detection has mostly been limited to research work
and showing results on the formally used kdd99 dataset. In this project I have developed  a 
simple mechanism for realtime intrusion detection using java pcap4j library and python to 
implement the detection. This code is able to detect intrusion with 97% of accuracy using K
nearest Neighbours algorithm.




The java program is completed with gui using simple java swing and it also uses maven support.
